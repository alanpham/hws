# HWS
These are the hacking with swift by Paul Hudson tutorial projects to get myself acclimated with Swift.

## Project 1
Simple Image Viewer app that lets the user scroll through a list of photos (in this case images of storms) and select which to view.

## Notes
Each folder correlates to a project in the Hacking with Swift book
